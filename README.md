Everyone wants it to end. However, there are fixers who refuse.

## Ender

Your goal is to stay insane and hungry so you can destroy the ship. Destroy the ship before the clock ends

## Fixer
The objectives of the Fixers are to fix what has been destroyed by Enders.Attempt to get as many people to survive.

Your goal is to keep Enders sane and bellies full, and repair the ship. Keep the ship somewhat repaired before the clock ends.

Enders will destroy equipment but only if all their stats are depleted (sanity and hunger).

Fixers will repair damages done by Enders and make sure they are fed and sane.
